        instructions: [

            "Dip Lady fingers. Add the coffee (espresso) to a shallow bowl. Dip the lady fingers in the coffee (Don't soak them--just quickly dip them on both sides to get them wet) and lay them in a single layer on the bottom of an 8x8'' or a similar size pan.",
            "Layer mascarpone. Smooth half of the mascarpone mixture over the top. Add another layer of dipped lady fingers. Smooth remaining mascarpone cream over the top.",

            "Watch for bubbles to form before flipping. Flipping too soon is a common mistake. A good rule is to wait until several bubbles form on the surface and for the bottom to be golden.",
            "Use a thin spatula for flipping. A thin, flexible spatula is the best option, as it slides easily under the pancakes without damaging them."
