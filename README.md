## About

A personal project that started as a static HTML/CSS recipe site that I created while working through the Foundations section of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). It was later redesigned into a dynamic, JavaScript-driven version.

You can view the original static version on the [`static-version` branch](https://github.com/ni-ki-web/Recipes-project/tree/static-version).


## Goals

- Practice semantic HTML and CSS layout design  
- Explore clean, responsive recipe card components  
- Automate repetitive structure using JavaScript  


## Why the Change?

After adding a few recipes manually, I realized creating separate `.html` files for each recipe was inefficient. I wanted to:

- Store recipe data in one place  
- Generate pages dynamically using JavaScript  
- Improve the developer and user experience  


## Tools & Skills

- HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox & Grid)
- Vanilla JavaScript (DOM manipulation, dynamic rendering)  
- Git & GitHub (branching, pull requests, version control)  
- Responsive design  
- UX thinking 


## Features

- Clean, responsive layout  
- All recipes dynamically rendered from one data file  
- Semantic HTML and accessibility-friendly structure  
- Smooth navigation from homepage to individual recipes  
- Credit links to original recipe sources


## Future Improvements

This is a work in progress, and I plan to keep building on it as I learn more. Upcoming features may include:

- Adding filtering or search functionality
- Storing recipe data externally (e.g., JSON or API)
- Enhancing responsiveness and accessibility


## Branches

- `main` - dynamic version (current live version)
- `static-version` - original static HTML/CSS version [view static repo](https://github.com/ni-ki-web/Recipes-project/tree/static-version)
