# Recipes-project
This is a beginner-level web development project where I am building a simple recipe website. It is part of my learning journey in web development.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** – for structuring the content
- **CSS** – for styling the page
- **JavaScript** *(coming soon)* – will be added later for interactivity

## Project Goals

- Practice and improve my HTML and CSS skills
- Build a functional and visually appealing recipe website
- Gradually add JavaScript to enhance interactivity
- Continuously expand and refactor the project as I learn new concepts
